Compiling module sweng2023.sweng.App
   Unification traversed 793 fields and methods and 413 types. 7 are considered part of the current module and 15 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([sweng2023.sweng.CreaDeckPage$2]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
