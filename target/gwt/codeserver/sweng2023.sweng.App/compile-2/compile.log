Compiling module sweng2023.sweng.App
   Unification traversed 1376 fields and methods and 674 types. 42 are considered part of the current module and 52 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([sweng2023.sweng.PokemonPage_PokemonUiBinderImpl$Widgets$1, sweng2023.sweng.YugiohPage_YugiohUiBinderImpl$Widgets$1, sweng2023.sweng.YugiohPage$2, sweng2023.sweng.MagicPage_MagicUiBinderImpl$Widgets$1]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
