Compiling module sweng2023.sweng.App
   Unification traversed 627 fields and methods and 316 types. 2 are considered part of the current module and 10 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([sweng2023.sweng.App$1MyHandler$1, sweng2023.sweng.App$1, sweng2023.sweng.App$1MyHandler]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
