Compiling module sweng2023.sweng.App
   Unification traversed 1100 fields and methods and 670 types. 16 are considered part of the current module and 26 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([sweng2023.sweng.Miacarta_FieldSerializer]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
