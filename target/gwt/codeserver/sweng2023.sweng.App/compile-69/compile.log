Compiling module sweng2023.sweng.App
   Unification traversed 691 fields and methods and 342 types. 10 are considered part of the current module and 18 had all of their fields and methods traversed.
   [WARN] Some stale types ([sweng2023.sweng.Loader$4$1, sweng2023.sweng.App$2$1]) were not reprocessed as was expected. This is either a compiler bug or a Generator has legitimately stopped creating these types.
